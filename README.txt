Defensins Database

A project to catalogue defensin related protiens. Main functions include:
- A search engine to search proteins of interest by description keywords or FASTA sequences.
- Relevant information on the searched protein, including molecular weight, FASTA sequence and commonly annotated sub-sequences.
- NGL viewport to house and interactive 3D structure of the searched proteins, as well as an option to download a screenshot of the structure.
- Protvista track to highlight sequence annotations (similar to the functionality in PDB), but also with an added interactive component to highlight the annotated sequences on the NGL interactive viewport.

Branches:
- Legacy
Code from development back in 2020 on a Windows 10 environment. Possibly rendered dysfunctional by LFS; mostly used for reference and archivial purposes.
- Main
Currently under development with the aim to reconstruct the legacy code on a Linux environment. The intention is to maintain the original functionality, but using more efficient tools for each part of the job.

Prerequisites to host the database:
- Apache > 2.4
- Python > 3.8.2
